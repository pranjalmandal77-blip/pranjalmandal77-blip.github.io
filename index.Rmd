# Pranjal Mandal

Hi! I am a UT Austin student majoring in Computational Biology and Statistics & Data Science. I enjoy data projects, computing data sets, and building small tools that make classwork easier.

## A few favorites
- Reading about microbes and  working on bioinformatics
- Building small R/Python scripts

```{r}
# Exact build time:
Sys.time()
```
